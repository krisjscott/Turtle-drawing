# 🛸 Among Us Impostor with Turtle

This Python project uses the **Turtle Graphics** library to draw a randomly-colored **Among Us** impostor character. The figure includes the **body**, **glass visor**, and **backpack**, making a full character representation on the screen. The body color is randomized using RGB values (0–255) each time the script is executed.
