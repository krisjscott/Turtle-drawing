# 🐢 Among Us Crewmate with Python Turtle

This project uses the built-in `turtle` module in Python to draw a **yellow crewmate** from the popular game *Among Us*. It’s a fun and beginner-friendly graphics project designed to demonstrate how Python can be used creatively to make art using code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular drawing with separate functions:
  - `body()` – draws the body of the crewmate
  - `glass()` – draws the blue visor
  - `backpack()` – draws the oxygen tank
- Easily customizable colors (`body_color` and `glass_color`)
- Uses simple turtle commands like `forward()`, `circle()`, and `begin_fill()` to create complex shapes
